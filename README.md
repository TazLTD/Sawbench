## :package: Requirements
- [QBCore Framework](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target)

## :brain: How It Works
A player approaches a placed sawbench prop.  
They interact using `ox_target`.  
The script checks if they have wood in their inventory (via `ox_inventory`).  
If yes:
- A progress bar appears.
- An animation plays with a wood prop attached to the hand.
- After completion, 1 wood is removed and 1 plank is added.

If canceled:
- The animation and prop are removed.

## ðŸ§° Installation

1. Download and extract the resource to your `resources` folder.
2. Ensure the folder is named `sawbench` (or match the name you use in `server.cfg`).
3. Add `ensure sawbench` to your `server.cfg`.
4. Make sure `ox_inventory`, `ox_target`, and `qb-core` are properly installed and started before this script.
5. Customize `config.lua` to fit your server (models, labels, durations, etc.).

**IMPORTANT**: If you donâ€™t have the Sawbench animation & prop, this script will not work. You can get it here: [Tebex Store - Sawbench Animation & Prop](https://bzzz.tebex.io/package/6743379).

### Add to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`

['wood'] = {
    label = 'Wood',
    weight = 1000,
    stack = true,
    close = true,
    description = 'A chunk of raw wood. Can be cut into planks.',
    client = {}
},

['plank'] = {
    label = 'Plank',
    weight = 800,
    stack = true,
    close = true,
    description = 'A wooden plank, cut from raw wood.',
    client = {}
},
